# astro-material-design
### Introduction
astro-material-design is an Astro component library that brings the sleek, modern, customizable, and consistent look of Material Design 3 to your Astro projects. It provides a set of components, utilities, and theming options to help you build beautiful user interfaces.

### Usage
#### Basic Setup
1. Make your own page in [src/pages](src/pages)
2. Import the components you'll use or import all components. Read [testing.astro](src/pages/testing.astro) for the imports.
3. Start coding with the components.

We will soon have a npm packages however for now we recommend cloning this repo or just copying the components folder into your astro project

### Components
The library includes a variety of Material Design 3 components, such as:

- Buttons
- Cards
- Typography
- Inputs
- Navigation
- ...and more

### Documentation
We will try to get a wiki at some point however currently, we suggest using [Material 3 UI docs](https://m3.material.io) and reading the props of the components in [src/components](src/components).
